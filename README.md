## üöß Current Limitations

1. **Backend Integration**

   - Backend functionality is not yet connected. Roadmap generation is mocked on the frontend.

2. **Authentication Issue**
   - A cookies issue requires manual setup to simulate an authenticated state for accessing the `/dashboard` route.

---

## üöö Workaround: Setting Up Quick Access

To view the dashboard, you'll need to set a temporary cookie. Here's how:

1. Open your browser's Developer Tools (`F12`)
2. Go to the Application/Storage tab
3. Find Cookies > localhost
4. Add a new cookie:
   - Name: `accessToken`
   - Value: `dummyToken123`

Once done, refresh the page and you will be redirected to `/dashboard`.

---

## üé® Future Enhancements

- **Backend Integration**: Connect the frontend to the Go backend for real-time roadmap generation.
- **AI Implementation**: Use Python and LangChain to provide dynamic marketing strategies.
- **Improved Authentication**: Resolve cookie handling for seamless user experience.
